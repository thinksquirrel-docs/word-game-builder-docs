Importing Languages {#importinglanguages}

## Overview
In order to use Word Game Builder, languages must be imported into a special format. A *language* consists of a word list, letter list, and some additional settings.

Word Game Builder includes letter and word lists for the following languages:

- English
- Spanish (Español)
- French (Français)
- Italian (Italiano)

These languages can be easily imported when Word Game Builder is installed for the first time. This can be done through the installer window, or at any time under **Tools > Thinksquirrel > Word Game Builder > Import Default Languages**.
